The aim of this game is to crash your komput√®r as fast as possible, by using the bonuses to open the most windows you can. Good luck !

## How to play ?

*You have to click on the closing cross to create another window, until you find special buttons to make more windows until your computer crashes.*

**To close the program, just right-click the text displayed in the window.**

*Sometimes, a button appears to show 50 others Windows, what makes easier for you to crash your PC. More often, a text with the memory bytes used by the program appears, just divide it by 1 000 000 (**a million**) to get it in Megabits (Mb).*

That's all for now, have fun and **don't use it on computers that aren't yours !** __I am not responsible of any damages or crash of the computer where it is used__, so run it carefully and only with the agreement of the device's owner.
